- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cantoaa, i have interest on working in software development, AI or web development. I started programming when i was 12 years old and i used to program on roblox, so i have a lot of experience in LUA and gaming development on roblox. Also i started a course when i was 13 called Happy Code, there i studied Unity, Android Development Apps and a little
bit of robotics. Now im studying Computer Engineering on the federal university UFSC. I have good foundantions on Python. C# and Java i learned when i was young, so i dont remind it well, but i just need a bit of time to remind everything. Currently im learning Java Script. I would like to have an internship, since im still on the college.
